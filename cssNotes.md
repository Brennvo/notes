**THESE HAVE NO STRUCTURE**
These are just snibbets of things I find important to look back on/reference in the future.
----

* Changing an `<img>` to `display: block;` removes it from its default inline property
* Width
    - `max-width: 100%` on something like an `<img>` will scale the image to fit the width of its container, **but the image won't stretch wider than its original width**
    - `width: 100%` will stretch the image to the full 100% of its parent
